# The History of Korean Names and Their Evolution

Korean names have a rich history shaped by culture, language, and tradition.

## 1. Ancient Times
- Names often came from nature or simple words.  
- Example: Go-un (고운) meaning “beautiful.”

## 2. Influence of Chinese Characters (Hanja)
- From the 7th century, Koreans adopted hanja-based names.  
- This brought deeper symbolic meaning.  

## 3. Modern Changes
- After the 20th century, shorter and softer names became popular.  
- More parents use pure Korean words (고유어 이름) instead of hanja.  

## 4. Recent Trends
- Names like Haru (하루, “day”) or Nari (나리, “lily”) show modern creativity.  

✨ Today, Korean names balance **tradition + modern uniqueness**, making them fascinating for foreigners to adopt.
