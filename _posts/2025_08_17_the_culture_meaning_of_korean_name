# The Cultural Meaning of Korean Names: A Guide for Foreigners

Choosing a Korean name is more than just translating sounds from English.  
In Korean culture, a name carries deep meaning, often linked to family heritage, virtues, and even life philosophy.  

## 1. Structure of a Korean Name
- **Family name (성, Seong)**: Usually one syllable (e.g., Kim, Lee, Park).
- **Given name (이름, Ireum)**: Typically two syllables, each with a unique meaning.
  - Example: **Ji-woo (지우)** → “Wisdom + House of Friendship”

## 2. Why Meanings Are Important
In Korea, parents choose names carefully with the hope of passing values or blessings.  
For example:
- **Ha-neul (하늘)** → “Sky,” symbolizing vast potential.  
- **Min-jun (민준)** → “Clever and talented.”  

## 3. Trends in Modern Korean Names
- Short and soft-sounding names are popular (e.g., Arin, Yuna, Jisoo).
- Nature-inspired names are rising: **Ara (아라, ocean), Haru (하루, day).**

## 4. Tips for Foreigners Choosing a Korean Name
1. Pick a family name that feels comfortable (Lee, Kim, Choi are common).  
2. Choose a given name with positive meaning, not just similar pronunciation.  
3. Check if the name is easy to pronounce for both Koreans and foreigners.
